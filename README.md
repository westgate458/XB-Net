## Introduction
This is a place-holder repository for future publication of the network and weights.
More contents will be available soon.

## Dependencies
- Platform: Centos 7.7
- Python version: 3.7
- Cuda version: 11.0.3
- PyTorch version: 1.7.0
- Additional dependencies: imageio(2.8.0), numpy(1.18.4), scipy(1.4.1), pillow(8.1.0), libtiff(4.2.0)

A full list of the conda enviroment packages can be found in `full_env.txt`, as output by `conda list --json`.

## To use current repo
### Image preprocessing and generate tertiary training targets
- Download and unzip datasets from CTC website [Link](http://celltrackingchallenge.net/2d-datasets/)
- Place unzipped training sets under `datasets\raw\[dataset_name]`, and it should have the following folder structure (e.g. DIC-C2DH-HeLa)
  ```
  datasets
  ├──raw
  │   └── DIC-C2DH-HeLa   (Name of the dataset)
  │       ├── 01          (Raw images for video sequence 01)
  │       ├── 01_ST       (ST annotations for video sequence 01)
  │       ├── 01_GT       (GT annotations for video sequence 01)
  │       ├── 02          (Raw images for video sequence 02)
  │       ├── 02_ST       (ST annotations for video sequence 02)
  │       └── 02_GT       (GT annotations for video sequence 02)
  └──pre
  ```    
- Under current dir, run python scripts for 2D or 3D datasets by `datasets\pre\[dataset_name]`
  ```
  python imgPre_2D_GT+ST.py DIC-C2DH-HeLa
  ```
- Normalized cell images and tertiary training targets will be written under
  ```
  datasets
  ├──raw  
  └──pre
      └──GT+ST                      (For data configuration GT+ST)
          └── DIC-C2DH-HeLa         (Name of the dataset)
              ├── 01                (Frames with ST annotations for the training set: normalized image\tertiary target pairs in npy format)
              ├── 01_GT\SEG         (Original instance masks in tiff format for performance evaluation on the training set)
              ├── 01_RES            (Placeholder folder to write evaluation result masks)
              ├── 02                (Frames with GT annotations for the validation set: normalized image\tertiary target pairs in npy format)
              ├── 02_GT             (Original instance masks in tiff format for performance evaluation on the validation set)
              ├── 02_RES            (Placeholder folder to write evaluation result masks)
              └── sample_pairs.png  (Randomly picked frames for visualization)
  ```  
- Normalized cell images and tertiary training targets will be written under
- **Note**: only scripts for GT+ST data configuration is included. Others can be obtained with minor modifications.
