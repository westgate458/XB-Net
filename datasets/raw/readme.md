Example: 

After unzip DIC-C2DH-HeLa.zip from CTC website [Link](http://celltrackingchallenge.net/2d-datasets/)
it should have the following folder structure

```
raw
└── DIC-C2DH-HeLa
    ├── 01      (raw images for video sequence 01)
    ├── 01_ST   (ST annotations for video sequence 01)
    ├── 01_GT   (GT annotations for video sequence 01)
    ├── 02      (raw images for video sequence 02)
    ├── 02_ST   (ST annotations for video sequence 02)
    └── 02_GT   (GT annotations for video sequence 02)
```
