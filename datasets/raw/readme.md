Put training set images here.

Example: 

After unzipping DIC-C2DH-HeLa.zip from CTC website [Link](http://celltrackingchallenge.net/2d-datasets/)
it should have the following folder structure

```
raw
└── DIC-C2DH-HeLa   (Name of the dataset)
    ├── 01          (Raw images for video sequence 01)
    ├── 01_ST       (ST annotations for video sequence 01)
    ├── 01_GT       (GT annotations for video sequence 01)
    ├── 02          (Raw images for video sequence 02)
    ├── 02_ST       (ST annotations for video sequence 02)
    └── 02_GT       (GT annotations for video sequence 02)
```
